Pytorch implementation of VAE-base Language Model. This code borrows from Sentence-VAE (https://github.com/timbmg/Sentence-VAE) repository and vae-lagging repository (https://github.com/jxhe/vae-lagging-encoder). Elements from both have been combined to incorporate aggressive training of VAE for Language Modeling task, whihc was then tested on PTB dataset.
